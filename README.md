# GHC version issues

This library has been entirely developed in GHC-7.10. Although efforts
are spent making it buildable with previous versions, some features may
be missing. If you need any of these missing features, opening an issue
will probably be enough to get me working on it.

# Travis build badge

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Daniel-Diaz/sorted-list.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Daniel-Diaz/sorted-list)

GHC versions used by the travis build:

* 7.4
* 7.6
* 7.8

This means `sorted-list` should compile easily against these versions of GHC.
